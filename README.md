# First Flutter App
This is the first Flutter app that I've ever made. It was made following the tutorial on Flutter's website.

## Running the app
- Make sure you have the ```Flutter CLI``` and ```Dart CLI``` installed.
- Clone this reposatory into a new folder
- Start dev process with ```F5``` (VS Code) or by entering ```> flutter run``` in a terminal
- Once the process is started, you can save to hot reload

## Finalizing / Building the app
The main feature in flutter is the ability to compile to multiple targets. To do this run ```flutter build --[TARGET]```. If I wanted to build for the web, I would wright ```flutter build --web```. <br />

Say I wanted to preview the final version of my app before I build it, I would select the "release mode" option in VS Code or alternativeally enter in the terminal ```flutter run --release``` <br />

If I wanted to proflile my app, I would select the "profile mode" in VS Code, or run ```flutter run --profile```.
